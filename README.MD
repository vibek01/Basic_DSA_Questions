# Basic DSA Practice â€“ Arrays to Linked Lists to Stacks & Queues

This repository contains my solutions to fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It covers essential concepts like arrays, strings, sorting, stacks, queues, linked lists, and basic object-oriented programming.

## ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Inside

- Topic-wise folders (e.g., `Arrays/`, `Stacks/`, `LinkedLists/`)
- Clean and well-structured code written mainly in **C++**, with some problems in **C**
- Problem-solving focused solutions without additional theory or notes

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repo serves as my personal practice vault to:
- Strengthen my understanding of basic DSA concepts
- Improve logic building and coding speed
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments

## ðŸ’» Language Used

- C++
- C (for some beginner-level problems)

## ðŸ§­ Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Strings
- Sorting
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Objects & Classes
